# Sysbox Quick Start Guide

This document shows, by way of example, how to deploy system containers and
quickly take advantage of their features.

It assumes you've [installed](../../README.md#supported-distros) Sysbox.

For an in-depth description of Sysbox's functionality, refer to the [Sysbox Users Guide](../user-guide/README.md).

Also, the [Nestybox blog site](https://blog.nestybox.com) has even more examples on
how to use system containers.
